A collection of writings, diagrams, and practical patterns on building resilient, scalable, and brutally simple network infrastructure. This repository captures lessons learned from real-world environments — from legacy brownfield networks with mixed routing protocols to modern datacenter fabrics, cloud hybrid connectivity, and enterprise wireless.
I approach infrastructure with a first-principles mindset:
	•	Simplicity beats complexity.
	•	Determinism beats “vendor magic.”
	•	Resilience comes from design, not hope.
	•	Technical debt always comes due — sometimes catastrophically.

Most of the content here originates from real incidents, rebuilds, audits, and large-scale cleanups I’ve performed across industries (retail, law, enterprise SAAS). Topics include:

### Topics I explore here
- Network architecture and simplification through first principles  
- Enterprise routing design (OSPF/BGP)  
- Datacenter fabrics (VXLAN/EVPN, ACI, NDFC)  
- Hybrid cloud (Azure/OCI) connectivity patterns  
- Wi-Fi/RF design and survey methodology  
- Identity-based access (802.1X / NAC)  
- Observability, consistency checking, and automation tooling  
- Systemic infrastructure risks (e.g., 2038 overflow)
