# Cloud vs. On-Prem: A Design Perspective

## What Does IT Really Provide?

At its core, every information system provides just three things:
- Compute Power – the power to process workloads
- Storage – a place to keep data
- Access to the above – for internal users, partners, and customers

That’s it. Everything else is built on top of these three fundamentals.

You can run these services on-prem, or through hosted providers.

Cloud, in the end, is just another form of hosted infrastructure — wrapped in APIs, billed by the usage, and branded with marketing.

But behind the branding, it still provides those same three things: compute, storage, and access.
More and more businesses are building their IT infrastructure in the cloud. But before jumping in, it’s important to ask:

What can cloud actually provide? What can it not? And what are the key differences between cloud and on-premises?

This article takes a closer look at those questions — not from a marketing point of view, but from a design and operational perspective.

Cloud is not just infrastructure in someone else’s datacenter.

It’s a different operating model — one that doesn’t follow traditional industry standards, and often prioritizes scale over compatibility.

That doesn’t make it bad. But it does mean your designs, your tools, and your expectations must change.

What really changes when you move to the cloud, and what still stays the same?

# 1. Deployment Speed

Let’s say a business needs to build a brand-new application from scratch.

If it’s built on-premises, the process looks like this:
- Secure physical space — whether in your own office or a colocation facility
- Install circuits from ISPs
- Order firewalls, switches, servers — wait for lead time and shipping
- Physically rack and cable everything
- Configure network and server infrastructure
- Then finally, deploy the application

This will take months, even with good coordination.

In contrast, with proper preparation, the same application can be deployed in Azure within hours or days. No shipping. No racking. No waiting.

That’s one of the biggest operational advantages cloud brings.

# 2. Team Knowledge Requirements

On-premises environments typically require a mix of specialists:
- Network engineers
- System and storage engineers
- Linux/Windows administrators
- Developers (if needed)

These roles are aligned with well-established industry standards — BGP is BGP, a switch is a switch, and everyone speaks the same language across vendors.

In the cloud, those roles still exist — but now your team also needs to understand the specifics of the platform itself.

Cloud providers don’t follow traditional standards. Each one comes with its own:
- Naming conventions
- Service architectures
- Configuration models
- Quirks and limitations

If you’re deploying in Azure, you need team members who understand how Azure works, not just how infrastructure works. The same applies to AWS, GCP and other cloud platforms.

And in the cloud, post-deployment changes are often restricted.

On-premises, most things can be changed later — though it’s not easy, it’s technically possible.

In the cloud, most settings can’t be changed once deployed. The only way to change them is to rebuild. For example, if you deploy a VM in a wrong virtual network in Azure, you can’t just move it — the only option is to redeploy it into the correct vNet and delete the old one.

This means your team must get it right the first time — from high-level architecture down to individual VM deployment.

A good cloud team isn’t just technical — they must understand the platform deeply and design carefully before building.

That applies to AWS, GCP, OCI, and others as well — each has its own learning curve.

# 3. Cost Model

On-premises cost structure is relatively predictable. You pay for:
- Utilities and physical space (office or colocation)
- Circuits and bandwidth
- Hardware (servers, firewalls, switches)
- Support contracts (hardware vendors, VMware, etc.)

Most of these costs are fixed and can be planned ahead.

There’s no simple way to estimate total cloud cost upfront.

Even if you know what you’re trying to build, the final cost depends on dozens of variables — including usage patterns, VM uptime, storage tiers, disk IOPS, network egress, API calls, logging volume, backup frequency, and regional pricing differences.

Many services are priced by the second, per request, or by data movement — and these charges often show up across hundreds of separate line items.

Even experienced teams can get caught off guard by things like premium storage defaults, cross-region replication, or the cost of diagnostic logs.

In some environments, invoices can run hundreds or even thousands of pages — making it nearly impossible to track or explain cloud spend line by line.

Another key difference is how the billing aligns with product lifecycle:
- In on-prem, even if a workload runs for just 1 day, you still need to invest in hardware, circuits, and rack space and so on.
- In cloud, you pay only for what you use. If the workload is short-lived, so is the cost.

In general:
- On-prem has high upfront cost, but low ongoing cost
- Cloud has low upfront cost, but high and variable ongoing cost

That trade-off matters — especially when planning for the long term.

# 4. Control and Visibility

In on-premises environments, you have full control.

You can configure hardware, software, network behavior — even customize platforms to fit unique business needs. Circuits might be the only exception, but beyond that, the environment is yours.
Cloud is a different story.

## Platform Exposure
In the cloud, you can only control what the provider allows.

For example, you can perform advanced BGP filtering or route summarization on your on-prem routers — but not in cloud platforms, where those options are either restricted or entirely unavailable.

And of course, you have no access to the underlay hardware or hypervisor, so things like interface-level monitoring or low-level tuning are off the table. Need SPAN? Not going to happen. 
## Change Control
Most organizations — especially in retail or finance — freeze production changes during critical periods like holiday seasons to prevent human-error related downtime.

In cloud, you have no control over when and where the provider makes changes to the platform.

Cloud providers deploy their own patches, feature updates, or infrastructure changes without your input or approval — and often without any advance notice.
## Product Life Cycle Control
On-prem, legacy hardware may live far beyond its recommended lifespan — sometimes because migration is expensive, sometimes because the vendor no longer exists.

While not ideal, it’s your choice.

In cloud, the life cycle is dictated by the provider.

When a service is deprecated, you’re notified with a deadline — and if you don’t migrate by then, the service will be shut down.
## Visibility
Cloud providers offer dashboards and APIs to monitor services, but visibility is limited — especially into the underlay.

Status pages are often delayed and may not reflect real-time outages.

In many cases, you’ll notice the problem before the provider does. And when that happens, you’re not the only one calling — thousands of customers are on hold, all waiting for a support engineer to pick up the phone.

# 5. Security

Security in on-premises environments is fully under your control.

You decide how systems are patched, how physical access is managed, and how firewalls, segmentation, and monitoring are implemented.

You can lock things down based on your exact standards — and inspect everything from firmware to cabling if needed.

In the cloud, security only applies to what the provider allows.

You’re responsible for configuring IAM, firewalls, and encryption — but the underlying infrastructure is out of reach.

That means:

You have to trust that the provider will defend the environment effectively - but unfortunately, every major cloud provider has security incidents that exposed customers to loss.

You have to trust they're not accessing your data - whether intentionally or unintentionally.

You have to hope attackers can't reach your environment through a weaker co-tenant - another customer sharing the same physical host, who may not follow good security practices.

Cloud providers talk about “shared responsibility,” but in practice, that means you’re responsible for everything they let you control, and they’re responsible for everything you can’t see.

Some cloud services even required to bypass your own security controls entirely. For example, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) require you to route traffic directly to Microsoft-managed endpoints in order to access core Azure services. In many organizations, this violates established security policy — especially in regulated environments where all traffic is expected to pass through centralized inspection points.

In those cases, you’re forced to either break your internal standards or give up using certain cloud-native services.

## 6. When the Provider Holds All the Power

In public cloud, you’re not a client — you’re a customer. And there’s a difference.

A client relationship is backed by contract. The provider is obligated by law to serve you, and termination isn’t easy or one-sided. Even if the provider fails to deliver the contracted service, you have legal grounds to sue and recover damages. There’s accountability.

But as a customer, you’re simply using a service — and the provider can cut you off at any time, for any reason, with or without explanation. You have no say, and no appeal. There have already been cases where cloud providers terminated services with just a few weeks’ notice. If you can’t move your data or migrate your systems by the deadline, it’s gone — permanently. For most businesses, that kind of timeline is nearly impossible to meet.

To be fair, this kind of event is rare. But a good engineer always asks:

“What if it does happen? And what’s our plan to keep the business running?”

With on-premises infrastructure, it’s a different story.

Your space. Your servers. Your data.

Even in a datacenter-level disaster, offsite disaster recovery is a standard and fully controlled practice.

Ownership brings responsibility — but it also brings resilience.

## 8.Conclusion

Cloud is well-suited for short-term deployments and for organizations that don’t have a strong on-prem hardware platform or only need a few lightweight applications. For long-running and predictable workloads, cost and control considerations often push the balance toward on-prem or hybrid designs.

It’s also a great option for offsite disaster recovery and offsite backups, as well as for handling burst traffic — especially in retail, where demand spikes during the holiday season and compute power can be rented just for that peak window.

However, for long-term deployments, cloud comes with serious trade-offs. You need to carefully evaluate cost, visibility, security, control, and operational fit. And always keep in mind: POCs turn into temporary solutions, and temporary solutions tend to become permanent — often without the planning they deserve.

Cloud is an emerging platform with the potential to transform how businesses build and run IT. Like any tool, it has strengths and weaknesses.

A good engineer doesn’t blindly follow trends — they choose the right tool for the job, based on what the business actually needs, not what marketing says is the future.
